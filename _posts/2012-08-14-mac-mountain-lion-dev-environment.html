It is a great pity that Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion has removed a list of important features - at least they are important for me since I will need to connect with multiple Linux servers and test. &nbsp; Well here's a list on everything should be installed - before getting your new toy into production.<br /><br />1) iTerm 2,<br />This is a great Terminal replacement, friendly to large screen users.<br /><br />2) Crack your <code>LC_CTYPE</code>,<br />see:&nbsp;<a href="http://notes.iyyang.com/2012/07/mac-lcctype.html">http://notes.iyyang.com/2012/07/mac-lcctype.html</a><br /><br />3) Xcode,<br />It is necessary to install Xcode - at least Xcode Command Line Tools. &nbsp; This provides some fundamental items i.e. <code>gcc</code>, <code>git</code>.<br /><br />4) gcc 4.8,<br />Download from: http://hpc.sourceforge.net/<br />It supports C++11.<br /><br />5) Github,<br />It's very good to host your stuff on github haha.
