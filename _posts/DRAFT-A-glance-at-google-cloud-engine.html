<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
I'm an AWS user since three years ago when Amazon EC2 (the virtual machine) was not yet available on AWS Management Console. &nbsp; I can still remember the night when I was trying to create a VM and stuck in one of the many APIs. &nbsp; &nbsp;It finally took me 2 days to get the account running and I can ssh to that instance via my Mac.<br /><br />Management Console is one of the most important features for individuals or even small business users, since it doesn't worth so much to understand hundreds of APIs for basically launching and terminating instances. &nbsp; And as a result, I really appreciate the instance managing features added to AWS Management Console. &nbsp; &nbsp;However the user experience of AWS Management Console is really poor - even though the UI has been redesigned this year. &nbsp; &nbsp;It's really slow when connecting from Asia, and still confusing for beginners since you have to set up security groups, access keys, and lots of different things.<br /><br />And I tried Google Cloud Engine today. &nbsp; I should the web console is much easier
