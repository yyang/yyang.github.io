<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
The installation manual of Trac is too complicated - I've copied all commands here:<br /><br />Requires Python 2.5+, setuptools 0.6+, Genshi 0.6+ and SQLite (already installed with Python 2.5+)<br /><br /><code>$ sh setuptools-0.6c11-py2.6.egg<br />$ easy_install Genshi</code>
