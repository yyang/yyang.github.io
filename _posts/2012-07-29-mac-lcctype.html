<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
To solve this:<br /><code>warning: setlocale: LC_CTYPE: cannot change locale (UTF-8)</code><br />Typically appeared when using OS X Lion and ssh to a remote server.<br /><br />Add the following line to your <code>~/.bash_profile</code> of OS X:<br /><code>export LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8"<code>
