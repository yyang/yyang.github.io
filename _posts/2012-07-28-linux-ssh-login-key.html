There are a number of tutorials teaching how to set up SSH Client Key, however they will require a copy of private key inside your <code>./ssh/known_hosts</code>. &nbsp; It could be difficult to manage and brings troubles when you are accessing from another device.<br /><br />Method (operates on local machine):<br /><br /><code># ssh-keygen -t rsa<br /># cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh user@server 'cat &gt;&gt; .ssh/authorized_keys'<br /># openssl rsa -in ~/.ssh/id_rsa -out key.pem </code><br /><br />The last line was used to generate a .pem key file, so that we can use this key file to access the server, via:<br /><br /><code># ssh -i key.pem user@server</code><br /><br />Connecting via Windows:<br /><a href="http://tuts.pinehead.tv/2011/11/21/connect-to-amazon-ec2-using-putty-private-key-on-windows/">http://tuts.pinehead.tv/2011/11/21/connect-to-amazon-ec2-using-putty-private-key-on-windows/</a><br /><br />Reference on RSA Key:<br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(algorithm)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(algorithm)</a>
